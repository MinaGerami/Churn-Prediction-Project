# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and identify patterns that lead to churn.

## Completed Steps
1. Converted categorical variables into numerical format using encoding techniques.
2. Normalized all numerical features using Min-Max scaling to bring values into the [0, 1] range.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, and implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for prediction. Results were saved and evaluated.
4. Applied Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) with KNN to assess model performance on each individual sample.
5. Performed Leave-N-Out Cross-Validation with configurable test size to evaluate the model across multiple folds. Generated detailed metrics including TP, TN, FP, FN, accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and others.

## Work in Progress
The project is currently in progress.
